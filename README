1. INTRODUCTION

The Link Bowl is an open source clone of a popular online url shortening
tool. Instead of trying make a URL as short as possible it aims to make
the url as memorable as possible. It does this by combining an adjective
or verb with a noun. Included are two lists capable of generating over 58
million unique memorable urls. The lists were compiled using 30000 of the
most common english words.  

2. REQUIREMENTS

You'll need PHP, Apache and Sqlite2 with its associated PHP module. 

3. INSTALLATION

 3.1 Copy to your web server and untar.
 3.2 Its best to give the service its own vhost, to make the urls short.
 3.3 Ensure Override All is in the vhost definition
 3.4 Edit the rewrite rules in .htaccess to match your domain
 3.5 Chown the ./database directory to the webserver user
 3.6 Point browser at http://yousite.domain/setup.php
 3.7 See config.php to set additional options 

4. CONFIGURATION

 4.1 Word lists
	Word lists are configurable in config.php. Each list MUST MUST MUST
	be PRIME in length. If they are not, your number of possible URLs
	will be much much smaller. Not all words will get used and phrases
	will be reused much faster. So yeah, make the list prime, or leave
	the existing lists. If you need to remove a few words, make sure
	you remove enough to make the list lengths prime again.
 4.2 URL List
	You can secure the url_list.php page by setting a username and 
	password. See the details and notes in config.php. You can also 
	enable or disable the front page link to the url_list.php page.
	In addition the number of urls shown per page is configurable
 4.3 Misc
	The following other items are configuable: Title, logo and the
	disclaimer message shown at the bottom of the shortened url page
	You can use delete.php to clear the database if needed. Note that
	any existing shortened urls will be lost if you do this.
